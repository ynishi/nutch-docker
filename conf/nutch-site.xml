  <description>(EXPERT)The fetcher buffers the incoming URLs into queues based on the [host|domain|IP]
  (see param fetcher.queue.mode). The depth of the queue is the number of threads times the value of this parameter.
  A large value requires more memory but can improve the performance of the fetch when the order of the URLS in the fetch list
  is not optimal.
